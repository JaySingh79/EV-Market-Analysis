# Market Analysis of Electric Vehicles (EV) in the U.S.

## Project Overview
The **Market Analysis of Electric Vehicles (EV) in the U.S**. project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the electric vehicle landscape in the United States. Utilizing a dataset containing detailed information on over 26,000 electric vehicles, this project examines trends in EV adoption, types of vehicles, and geographical distribution across various states and counties.

## Key Features
- **Data Collection**: The project uses the **Electric Vehicle Population Data**, which includes vital details such as VIN, make, model, year, electric range, and MSRP.
- **Adoption Trends**: Visualizations highlight the growth of EV registrations over time, showcasing how consumer preferences have evolved.
- **Vehicle Type Distribution**: The analysis categorizes different types of electric vehicles, including Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), providing insights into market segmentation.
- **Geographical Insights**: The project maps out EV registrations by county and city, identifying regions with the highest adoption rates and potential markets for future growth.
- **Manufacturer Popularity**: It evaluates the top manufacturers based on vehicle registrations, helping to understand market leaders and consumer preferences.

## Implementation Details
The analysis is conducted using Python with libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization, and NumPy for numerical operations. Key steps include:
1. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and ensuring data integrity.
2. **Visualizations**: Creating bar plots to represent trends in EV adoption, vehicle types, and geographical distributions.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Using descriptive statistics to summarize key findings and trends in the dataset.

## Conclusion
This project serves as a valuable resource for stakeholders interested in the electric vehicle market, including policymakers, manufacturers, and consumers. By providing detailed insights into current trends and future opportunities, it aims to contribute to the ongoing conversation about sustainable transportation solutions in the U.S.
